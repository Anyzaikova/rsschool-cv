### Summary about me:
   I graduated from the University of Civil Engineering. I managed to work in my specialty for several years. During this time, I realized that I don't like this area, and I would like to find myself in something more creative and individual. I believe that the frontend development area will just allow me to realize myself. I like to learn new things, overcome difficulties and move forward.

const sentence = 'When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die';

function makeCensored(sentence, arr){
  let str1=sentence.split (' ');
  const newArray=[];
  const bad='$#%!';
  for (let i=0;i<str1.length;i++) {
    if (arr.includes(str1[i])) {
      newArray.push(bad);
    } else {
      newArray.push(str1[i]);
        }      
    }
